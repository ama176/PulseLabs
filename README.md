1. Introduction

What is Pulse?

Pulse is an innovative, fully-decentralized RPC (Remote Procedure Call) hosting infrastructure specifically tailored for developers and blockchain-powered platforms that are operating within the Solana ecosystem. The platform is designed to provide high-availability, low-latency, and cost-effective RPC endpoints, which developers can leverage to ensure their decentralized applications (dApps) function efficiently, without interruption, and scale according to user demand. By offering this layer of infrastructure, Pulse not only democratizes access to critical blockchain connectivity but also enhances the speed and dependability of applications that rely on blockchain queries and interactions.

Why RPC Hosting Matters

Within the broader context of blockchain development, RPC endpoints are the lifelines that connect applications to the underlying network infrastructure. Whenever a wallet checks a balance, a dApp queries account history, or a smart contract is executed, an RPC endpoint is responsible for transmitting that data between the client and the blockchain. For developers, especially those building on Solana, having dependable, rapid, and scalable RPC hosting means that their users experience fewer slowdowns, fewer dropped transactions, and more real-time feedback. Traditional public RPC endpoints are often rate-limited, congested, or simply unreliable, making Pulse's offering not just useful, but essential for anyone building high-performance applications on-chain.

Vision & Mission

Pulse Labs is driven by a singular vision: to revolutionize the way developers connect to blockchain infrastructure by removing friction, reducing costs, and offering powerful tools that are both easy to use and highly performant. Our mission is to create a global network of RPC endpoints that are not only fast and reliable but also accessible via a decentralized token-based model. Through innovation, community-driven development, and a relentless focus on developer experience, we aim to set a new standard for blockchain infrastructure.

2. Getting Started

How to Register

The onboarding process is intentionally simple, intuitive, and developer-friendly. To register for a Pulse RPC endpoint, users need to visit the Pulse Labs homepage. On this page, they will encounter an interface where they are prompted to input a valid email address. Once submitted, the user is instantly provided with a temporary RPC endpoint URL, valid for a 24-hour evaluation period. This mechanism allows developers to test the performance and reliability of our system with zero upfront commitment.

Payment Options

For those ready to extend their usage, we support seamless payment integrations through both the native Solana token (SOL) and our proprietary utility token, $PULSE. Users who choose to pay with SOL gain access to fixed-rate plans, while $PULSE token holders benefit from tiered discounts, staking rewards, and preferential access tiers.

Quickstart Example

curl https://rpc.pulselabs.io/demo-xyz123 \
  -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"method":"getSlot","params":[],"id":1,"jsonrpc":"2.0"}'

This command enables developers to send a simple request to retrieve the current slot number from the Solana blockchain using their assigned endpoint. It demonstrates how easy it is to integrate Pulse into existing toolchains.

3. Pulse Dashboard

Metrics Overview

The Pulse Dashboard is a comprehensive control panel that allows developers to track and analyze every aspect of their RPC usage. The top-level overview includes information such as:

RPC Usage %: Indicates how much of your allotted capacity has been consumed.

Daily Request Count: Reflects the volume of transactions and queries processed.

Average Latency: Displays the mean time taken to resolve requests.

Visibility & Traffic

With our data visualization tools, developers gain unparalleled insight into their dAppâ€™s network traffic. Interactive graphs show usage trends over the course of hours, days, and weeks, with granular breakdowns by:

Source country of origin

Device/browser type

Transaction method category

Optimization Score

Each endpoint is evaluated in real time by our optimization engine. Scores range from 0% (unhealthy) to 100% (optimal) based on:

Server response consistency

Network throughput

Average drop and error rates

User Tracking

Real-time analytics reveal how many distinct users (by wallet address or IP) are interacting with your RPC node. This is particularly useful for debugging user onboarding or monitoring bot activity.

4. Token Utility

What is $PULSE?

$PULSE is the heartbeat of our platform. It is not just a payment token, but a multi-purpose access credential, rewards mechanism, and governance tool. It allows users to unlock advanced services, earn rebates, and participate in platform governance through future DAO mechanisms.

Use Cases

$PULSE can be used for:

Paying for long-term RPC hosting plans

Unlocking access to Pro and Enterprise tiers

Voting on future platform upgrades

Receiving loyalty-based airdrops and bonuses

Discount Model

Users who pay with $PULSE receive discounts up to 50% compared to those paying in SOL. The longer you hold, the more you saveâ€”via a time-weighted discount model that rewards commitment.

Tokenomics

Our token economy is built with longevity in mind:

Total Supply: 100,000,000 $PULSE

Initial Distribution: 20% to community, 30% to contributors, 30% to ecosystem fund, 20% liquidity

Burn Model: A portion of each $PULSE spent is permanently removed from circulation

6. Technical Docs

RPC Endpoint Format

Each assigned RPC follows this structure:

https://rpc.pulselabs.io/demo-[id]

This URL is unique and bound to your registered email or wallet address.

Rate Limiting

Pulse enforces strict but flexible rate limiting to ensure quality of service. Users exceeding their quota will see:

HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests)

Null responses if throttled

Uptime Guarantees

Free Tier: No SLA

Starter/Pro: 99.5% uptime SLA

Enterprise: 99.9% SLA with active monitoring

7. Developer Tools

CLI

Our future CLI will offer the ability to:

Register new endpoints
